I highly recommend to at least read the parts where the experimental design and the experimental procedure are described, in order to properly understand how the data was recorded. The whole data is openly distributed on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/c4wkx/). \n",

For our purpose however, this does not matter. Yet, in general it would be recommendable to do both, preprocessing and analysis, with the same toolbox.*"
